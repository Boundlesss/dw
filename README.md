Old Source code found on one of my external hard-drives. Use if you want, but I do warn you, the code isn't efficient and can be broken. The reason why I am uploading this is because I want others to get inspiration.

Digital World was a project that was started in early 2017 and ended on Summer 2017 due to lack of progress and no official point of making this. 
You may find some code that hasn't been used and some unfinished features, so if anyone does actually complete the game's development, I will be impressed, though, not recommended.
